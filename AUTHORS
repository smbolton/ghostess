ghostess - A GUI host for DSSI plugins

This is sloppy, hurried HACKWARE -- please do not consider
this exemplary of the authors' skills or preferences, nor
of good DSSI or general programming practices. (In particular,
I don't want anyone attributing my mess to Chris or Steve ;-)

ghostess began life as dssi_example_host from the DSSI 0.1
distribution, which was a fine program written by Chris Cannam and
Steve Harris.

Then I started hacking on it.  First I hacked support for
run_multiple_synths() into it, which made it a mess.  This would
have been a great time for a ground-up rewrite, but that didn't
happen. Then I hacked a simple GUI into it, which made it even more
messy.  Then I threw in configuration saving, for yet more messiness.
Then I added a CoreMIDI driver -- more mess.  Then I mixed in JACK
MIDI support -- another layer of more mess.  And still no ground-up
rewrite.
