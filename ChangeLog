 * ghostess now searches for plugins on both DSSI_PATH and
     LADSPA_PATH (in that order), and will load a DSSI-style UI for
     a LADSPA plugin found on either path.  This is to better
     support FLAM, which generates DSSI-style GUIs for LADSPA
     plugins.
 * ghostess_universal_gui now uses its argv[0] (UI path) to find the
     plugin DSO instead of searching DSSI_PATH or LADSPA_PATH.

 * Update eyecandy.c to avoid crash on Mac OS X Snow Leopard with
     GTK+ 2.24.8.
 * Goldbug! (Add '-ldl -lm' to link flags.)
 * Default port value setting did not respect LADSPA_HINT_INTEGER.
 * Added notification at startup of which MIDI source ghostess is
     using.

 * On some OSes (OS X, and maybe Apple iOS), dlopen() defaults to
     RTLD_GLOBAL, unlike practically the entire rest of the known
     universe, which defaults to RTLD_LOCAL.  Yes, it's allowed by
     POSIX, but what the hell were they thinking?

20100905
 * Configuration file saving and loading is more locale-flexible:
     floating-point numbers are always written using '.' for the
     decimal point, regardless of locale setting, and when they are
     read, either '.' or the locale-specific decimal point may be
     used.
 * Added a manual page.

 * Added JACK session management support from Torben Hohn.
 * Cleaned up source copyright and license notices.

20081213
 * Added 'sample-rate' OSC method.
 * Using nice cairo knobs in universal_gui (requires GTK+ 2.8.0).

20081210
 * Fixed incoming OSC method handling to echo messages that come
     from a source other than our 'known' UI to the known UI.

20081209
 * Removed obsolete automake/autoconf macros.

20081205
 * Changed to use jack_client_open() instead of deprecated
     jack_client_new() (requires jack >=0.99.14).
 * Fixed output port connection to avoid JACK MIDI ports.

20081029
 * Dmitry Baikov's fixes for ALSA client type (now 'application')
     and JACK MIDI API changes.
 * Added test note widgets to ghostess_universal_gui.

20061127
 * Updated JACK MIDI API support, and added autoconf detection.
 * Fixed a bug in the MIDI de-jitter code.
 * Added blinkies for MIDI activity.
 * Added patch list export for freewheeling.

20050916
 * Added a '-noauto' command line option to disable automatic
     connection of output ports to JACK physical output ports.
 * 'About ghostess' now shows host OSC URL and MIDI connection
     method.

20050531
 * Quickly added somewhat-messy JACK MIDI support.  Argh, but this
     thing needs a ground up rewrite!

20050516
 * Chris Hixon's controlInsTotal fix
